# ec-code-SOZAbit
we are code SOZAbit team: Alaa, Osama, Sondos, and Zein.
 
 we created a mini shopping website to help both buyers and sellers.
 
 
 you can add your products as a seller and edit them later, or even delete them.
 you can buy items and add them to your cart or delete them from it.
 
 
 the website opens on the buyer page, you can then move with a button to the seller page and add your products.
 or you can move to your cart as a buyer and purchase the products you chose or just delete them
 you can see the number of the products you added and the total price.
 
 in future, we would like to upgrade our website, provide shipping service, choose payment methods...etc.
